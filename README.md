# 🌍 Tokenized Environmental Impact Tracker

## 📘 Project Title
**Tokenized Environmental Impact Tracker**

## 📝 Project Description
The Tokenized Environmental Impact Tracker is a blockchain-based system that rewards individuals with tokens for engaging in eco-friendly actions such as recycling, biking, using public transport, and reducing carbon footprints. Users submit verifiable proof of these activities, which are reviewed by validators or oracles. Upon approval, users are rewarded with ECO tokens.

The project is deployed on **CoreDAO**, a scalable and EVM-compatible blockchain, ensuring low fees and secure token management.

## 🌱 Project Vision
Our mission is to create a decentralized and transparent incentive system that promotes sustainable behavior and environmental responsibility. By leveraging blockchain technology and real-world validators, we aim to build a global community that is both environmentally conscious and empowered through tokenization.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 🏆 **Gamification**: Levels, achievements, and NFTs for consistent contributors.
- 📱 **Mobile App Integration**: Direct proof uploads via a mobile app.
- 🏛️ **Local Government Partnerships**: City-wide sustainability challenges.
- 🌐 **Carbon Credit Integration**: Linking ECO tokens to real-world carbon credits.
- 🗳️ **DAO Governance**: Token holder voting on key decisions and rules.
