# Tokenized Environmental Impact Tracker

## 📘 Project Title
**Tokenized Environmental Impact Tracker**

## 📝 Project Description
The Tokenized Environmental Impact Tracker is a blockchain-based system that rewards individuals with tokens for engaging in eco-friendly actions such as recycling, biking, using public transport, and reducing carbon footprints. Users submit verifiable proof of these activities, which are reviewed by validators or oracles. Upon approval, users are rewarded with ECO tokens.

The project is deployed on CoreDAO, a scalable and EVM-compatible blockchain, ensuring low fees and secure token management.

## 🌱 Project Vision
Our mission is to create a decentralized and transparent incentive system that promotes sustainable behavior and environmental responsibility. By leveraging blockchain technology and real-world validators, we aim to build a global community that is both environmentally conscious and empowered through tokenization.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- **Gamification**: Introduce levels, achievements, and NFTs for users who consistently contribute to sustainability.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Allow users to upload proof directly through a user-friendly mobile app.
- **Partnerships with Local Governments**: Incentivize city-wide sustainability challenges.
- **Carbon Credit Integration**: Link ECO tokens to real-world carbon credits.
- **DAO Governance**: Enable token holders to vote on platform changes and validation rules.
