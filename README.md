## 📝 Project Description  
The **Tokenized Environmental Impact Tracker** is a blockchain-based platform designed to incentivize eco-friendly behavior using smart contracts and tokenomics. Users earn **ECO tokens** for verified sustainable actions like recycling, biking, using public transport, or reducing carbon emissions.  

Each submission is reviewed by validators or trusted oracles. Upon successful verification, tokens are minted and awarded to the user — all securely handled on **CoreDAO**, ensuring low transaction fees and high scalability.

---

## 🌱 Project Vision  
To create a **decentralized and transparent reward system** that fosters **environmental responsibility**. By combining **real-world verification mechanisms** with **token incentives**, we aim to build a global community committed to sustainability and accountability.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope  

- 🏆 **Gamification**: Unlock levels, achievements, and NFTs for consistent eco-contributions.  
- 📱 **Mobile App Integration**: Submit proofs directly via mobile camera or gallery.  
- 🏛️ **Local Government Partnerships**: Organize regional sustainability missions and rewards.  
- 🌐 **Carbon Credit Integration**: Peg ECO tokens to verifiable carbon offset credits.  
- 🗳️ **DAO Governance**: Let token holders vote on project rules, rewards, and roadmap decisions.
